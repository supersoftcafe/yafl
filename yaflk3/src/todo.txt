Remove 'Counter' from 'Ast' and use 'Namer' instead, as encourages more parallelism and can be retained for later at each node level.
Get rid of tuple unpack. Apply operator takes callable expression result as right arg and a call is curried explicitly instead:
  e.g someValue |> doSomething(87, $1)
  is equivalent to to doSomething(87, $1)(someValue)
Conditional apply (think Monad) operator is done like Haskell using map that takes callable param.
