DONE: Refactor ExpressionCall to load function reference and obtain tuple of parameter values simply.
Refactor ExpressionLoadVariable and ExpressionLoadField to return function reference correctly.


Support methods on struct/class with vtable generation by method signature
- How many collisions are happening?
- Are there simple ways to reduce the collision count?
Support interfaces with compile time checks and automatic conversion
- Might want to finish the auto conversion operators to avoid having
  more than one auto conversion mechanic.

Support generics
Support traits to provide functional constraints on generics
Support enums (without optimisations just yet)
- Common methods available between all enum variants via a single unambiguous member
  of each variant are surfaced as kinda-ish member methods.
- Parameter shorthand a:Type1|Type2|Type3 is an anonymous enum.
Support when expressions to select on enum type and unpack
Support anonymous capturing object creation
Support capturing nested functions
